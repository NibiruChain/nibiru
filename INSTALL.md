## 1. Update the system

On Ubuntu, start by updating your system

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade --yes
```

## 2. Install Golang

Steps described here: https://go.dev/doc/install

## 3. Install build requirements

Install make and gcc.

```bash
sudo apt install git build-essential ufw curl jq snapd --yes
wget -q -O - https://git.io/vQhTU | bash -s -- --version 1.16
```

After installed, open new terminal to properly load go

## 4. Clone the Nibiru Repository

```sh
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/NibiruChain/nibiru
cd nibiru
```

On this fresh clone of the repo, simply run

```sh
make build
make install
make localnet
```

and open another terminal.

## Upgrade

The scheduled mainnet upgrade to `nibiru-2` is planned for

```
cd nibiru
git fetch tags
git checkout v0.0.1
```

Testnet

One the Nibiru binary has been installed, for further information on joining the testnet, head over to the [testnet repo](https://github.com/NibiruChain/Networks/tree/main/Testnet).

Mainnet

One the Nibiru binary has been installed, for further information on joining mainnet, head over to the [mainnet repo](https://github.com/NibiruChain/Networks/tree/main/Mainnet).

## Troubleshooting

A. If after steps 1-4 you don't have the `nibid` command, your go/bin directory may not be in your PATH yet. To do so, add the below to your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

B. New commands you've made on the `nibid` don't show up. Your `nibid` probably just isn't updated again after the code changes, to recompile nibid run `make install` in the root

## Contributing

The code for `nibid` is located in the `/cmd/nibid` folder.

In addition to the commands available within that folder, `nibid` pulls in cli subcommands from the modules e.g. `/x/oracle/cli`

After updating the code run

```bash
make build
make install
```

To see all the commands available just add `--help` to the end.

Example:

```bash
nibid --help
nibid query --help
nibid tx --help
nibid query oracle --help
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error when running `make install` on MacOS

If you get an error like this when running `make install` on MacOS:

```
/bin/sh: wget: command not found
```

You can fix it by installing `wget` with Homebrew:

```
brew install wget
```
