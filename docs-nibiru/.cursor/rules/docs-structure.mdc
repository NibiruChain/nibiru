  - `docs/dev`: Developer-oriented task solutions.
  - `docs/run-nodes`: Full node operation guides.

### 3. Tutorials (Learning Docs)
- **Purpose:** Walkthroughs designed to teach foundational skills and build familiarity through hands-on practice.
- **Examples:** Building a simple dApp, deploying your first node.
