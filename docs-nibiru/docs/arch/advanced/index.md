# Advanced Topics (Nibiru Architecture)

This section covers lower-level, advanced features that are generally
developer-facing. The subject matter isn't necessarily more difficult than in
other parts of the documentation, but these concepts will only become relevant as
you develop more ambitious solutions. {synopsis}

| In this Section | Synopsis |
| --- | --- |
| [Securing the EVM for a Quantum Future: Cryptographic Primitives, Threats, and ML-DSA](quantum-resistant-cryptography.md) | Discover how ML-DSA leverages lattice-based cryptography to secure the Ethereum Virtual Machine against emerging quantum computing threats.
| [Dev Gas Contract Revenue Mechanism](./devgas.md) | Blockchain module that shares contract execution fees with smart contract developers. This aims to increase the adoption of Nibiru by offering CosmWasm smart contract developers a direct source of income based on usage. 
| [Protobufs](./protobuf.md) | Protocol Buffer reference for "protos" used on Nibiru. |
| [Cosmos-SDK Modules](./cosmos-sdk/index.md) | Comprehensive Cosmos-SDK module reference documentation. Nibiru inherits many of these modules, so we've included their documentation for completeness. |
| [Implementation of the NIBI Tokenomics](./inflation.md) | Blockchain module that manages the creation of NIBI tokens as outlined by the tokenomics.
| [Keys and the Keyring](./keys.md) | Protocol Buffer reference for "protos" used on Nibiru. |
