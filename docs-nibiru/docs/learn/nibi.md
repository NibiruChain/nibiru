#  Nibiru (NIBI) Token

Nibiru tokens, commonly called "NIBI" tokens, are the native cryptocurrency of the Nibiru
blockchain. NIBI tokens play a pivotal role in proof-of-stake
[consensus](../concepts/consensus.md) and
decentralized governance, and they're used to pay gas and include transactions in a block. . {synopsis}

## Core Token Utility (NIBI)

**Consensus (Proof-of-Stake)**: 
NIBI tokens power the network’s Proof-of-Stake consensus and [decentralized governance](../concepts/gov/), a process by which NIBI stakers can decide on and bring about changes in the network. 

NIBI is also utilized to secure the network and pay for computation in the form of [gas fees](../concepts/gas.md), essential for facilitating the creation of new blocks on the chain. Consequently, NIBI is "Ether" in the [Nibiru EVM](../evm/).

Token holders who stake or delegate their tokens to a validator operator for
purposes of securing the network and achieving consensus may receive staking
rewards.

### Community - Community Pool

- **Usage Incentives**: (Subject to decentralized governance) Likely used to incentivize liquidity provision or dApp usage on Nibiru Chain.
- **Builder Grants**: See [Nibiru Grants](https://nibiru.fi/ecosystem/grants).

### Community - Strategic Reserve

The treasury is constructed as a discretionary fund to ensure the stability of the protocol. The treasury will initially be managed by multi-sig wallets held by members of the core team or their related smart contracts.

## Ways NIBI can Appear 

NIBI is most often represented as micro-NIBI (μnibi) with denomination "unibi"
on-chain. 
$$1 \;\text{ NIBI} := 10^6 \;\text{ unibi} = 1000000\;\text{unibi}$$
