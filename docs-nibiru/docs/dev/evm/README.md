# Nibiru EVM Guides

The Nibiru Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) serves as the runtime environment for
EVM smart contracts on Nibiru Chain. It enables secure and efficient deployment
of smart contract applications and runs bytecode compiled from Solidity,
providing a versatile platform for developers. {synopsis}

## Quickstart

[Nibiru EVM | Quickstart](./quickstart.md):  Learn how to run a local Nibiru network with an active Ethereum JSON-RPC
endpoint. This opens the door to deploy EVM smart contracts and interact with
wallets and other clients like Ethers.js.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The EVM is a decentralized computing platform that runs smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, where they execute securely and autonomously. The EVM interprets and executes the compiled bytecode, ensuring consistent execution across all nodes in the network.

## Key Features and Benefits

- Secure Environment: EVM smart contracts operate in a secure, isolated environment that prevents interference with the underlying blockchain or other contracts.
- Efficient Execution: The EVM is designed to execute bytecode efficiently, optimizing resource usage and transaction processing.
- Solidity Programming Language: Smart contracts are primarily written in Solidity, a high-level language tailored for Ethereum, offering features that facilitate complex contract development.
- Compatibility with Ethereum and Nibiru Networks: EVM contracts are fully compatible with both the Ethereum and Nibiru blockchains, ensuring they can leverage robust infrastructure and wide adoption.
- Decentralized Execution: The EVM allows for decentralized execution of contracts, ensuring that the outcomes are tamper-proof and transparent.
