## Introduction to CosmWasm Contracts

CosmWasm is a smart contract platform designed for the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling the secure
and efficient execution of smart contracts on blockchain networks like the Cosmos Hub. Contracts
developed in CosmWasm are compiled into WebAssembly (Wasm), providing a secure and sandboxed
environment for their execution.

## Key Features and Benefits

- Secure Environment: CosmWasm contracts run in a secure and isolated environment, ensuring that they cannot interfere with the underlying blockchain's operation
- Efficient Execution: Being compiled to Wasm, CosmWasm contracts offer efficient execution, making them suitable for various use cases, including tokenization and DeFi applications.
- Rust Programming Language: Contracts are developed in Rust, a language known for its safety features and performance, ensuring reliable and robust smart contract development.
- Compatible with Nibiru Chain: CosmWasm contracts can be deployed and executed on the Nibiru Chain, providing developers with a platform to build and deploy their contracts.
