# Block Explorers

Explorers enable you to search the history of Nibiru for transactions, blocks, accounts, smart contracts, and other activities on the Nibiru blockchain. {synopsis}

## What is a Block Explorer?

A block explorer is an online tool that monitors and displays data on a blockchain network. It enables users to search for specific transactions, review account balances, track contract interactions, and more. Block explorers also often offer features such as wallet integrations and interfaces for [decentralized
governance](./governance.md).

## Nibiru Block Explorers  

Explore blockchain activity on Nibiru with the following block explorers. **EVM explorers** provide insights into smart contracts, token transactions, and account balances, while **Interchain explorers** track Cosmos-SDK-based transactions and governance activities.  

### **EVM Block Explorers** (For Smart Contracts & Tokens)

### Which Explorer Should I Use?  

- **Use an EVM Explorer** if you're tracking **smart contracts, token transfers, or EVM transactions**.  
- **Use an Interchain Explorer** if you're looking for **staking, governance, or Cosmos-SDK-based transactions**.

## Key Features of Nibiru Block Explorers

Nibiru Network explorers offer the following features:

- **Real-time Transaction Tracking**: Search for specific transactions to view statuses, block confirmations, and timestamps.
- **Account Balance and Activity Monitoring**: Track wallet balances, transaction histories, and account activity for Interchain and EVM accounts.
- **Validator and Governance Monitoring**: Access information on validator statuses, governance proposals, and voting activities.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: View smart contract details, including deployed contracts, and monitor interactions for EVM and Interchain networks.

### Interchain and EVM Networks

Nibiru Network explorers are categorized by network type:

- **Interchain Explorers**: These are designed for tracking transactions, blocks, and account data on Nibiruâ€™s Interchain layer, optimized for Wasm VM-based interactions.
- **EVM Explorers**: These explorers provide a familiar environment for users engaging with Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and transactions, allowing EVM-compatible applications to be monitored and managed on Nibiru.
