# Postmortem

## Summary

On Sept 30 @ 22:16:01 UTC time, the `nibiru-itn-2` network halted at block `1131575`. 

## Root Cause

The binary was missing a wasm extension that copies the `wasm` smart contract folder for state syncs. Nodes that joined the network via state sync were missing `wasm` smart contracts. Later on, these nodes became validator nodes, and the set of smart contracts differed between validator nodes.

A tx in block `1131574` was submitted against one of these missing smart contracts (with code_id 3). Some validators were able to execute the tx successfully and other validators errored out since they didnâ€™t have the wasm smart contract in their local disk. Hence the chain halted while validating the `app_hash` in block `1131575`. 

## Resolution

The issue was fixed in [PR #1616](https://github.com/NibiruChain/nibiru/pull/1616) and backported to the [v0.21.x release branch](https://github.com/NibiruChain/nibiru/tree/releases/v0.21.x) (currently in [v0.21.11](https://github.com/NibiruChain/nibiru/releases/tag/v0.21.11)).
