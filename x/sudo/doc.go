package sudo

/*
Package sudo provides a simple way to manage, verify, and run smart contracts
with elevated permissions, mimicking the functionality of a Unix-based sudoers
file.

In the context of Unix-based operating systems, such as Linux and macOS,
"sudoers" refers to a configuration file that defines which users have the
privilege to execute commands with elevated (superuser) permissions using the
"sudo" command.

The superuser, also known as the root user, has full
administrative access to the system, allowing them to perform tasks that regular
users cannot do, such as installing system-wide software, and modifying system
files.

Note that this package does not provide actual system integration or execute
commands with elevated privileges. It only offers a way to manage and verify
permissions in a sudoers-like manner within your application.
