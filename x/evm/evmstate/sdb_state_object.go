// TODO: UD-DEBUG: What can be extracted from the stateObject docs and brought
// over.
//
// stateObject represents the state of a Nibiru EVM account.
// It encapsulates both the account data (balance, nonce, code) and the contract
// storage state. stateObject serves as an in-memory cache and staging area for
// changes before they are committed to the underlying storage.
//
// Key features:
// 1. It uses AccountWei, which represents balances in wei for EVM compatibility.
// 2. It maintains both the original (committed) storage and dirty (uncommitted) storage.
// 3. It tracks whether the account has been marked for deletion (suicided).
// 4. It caches the contract code for efficient access.
//
// stateObjects are used to:
// - Efficiently manage and track changes to account state during EVM execution.
// - Provide a layer of abstraction between the EVM and the underlying storage.
// - Enable features like state reverting and snapshotting.
// - Optimize performance by minimizing direct access to the underlying storage.

// TODO: Read up on EIP-6780 and make sure it's honored.
//
// (deleted) is an EIP-6780 flag indicating whether the object is eligible for
// self-destruct according to EIP-6780. The flag could be set either when
// the contract is just created within the current transaction, or when the
// object was previously existent and is being deployed as a contract within
// the current transaction.
