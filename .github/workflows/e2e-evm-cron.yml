jobs:
  # The "evm-e2e-cron" job runs end-to-end tests on a schedule against instances
  # of Nibiru to ensure core functionality remains stable. This is intended to
  # highlight any outage or catch degredations in public endpoint functionality
  # early. Failures trigger immediate Slack notifications to alert the team.
  #
  # This workflow:
  # 1. Executes basic EVM integration tests against the testnet
  # 2. Uses a dedicated test wallet (configured via secrets)
  # 3. Reports failures to the testnet Slack channel
  #
  # Environment requirements:
  # - WALLET_MNEMONIC_TESTNET: Secret for test wallet access
  # - SLACK_WEBHOOK_TESTNET: Webhook URL for failure notifications
