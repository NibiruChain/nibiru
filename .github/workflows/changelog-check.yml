  # This implementation handles CHANGELOG.md checks for a monorepo, ensuring
  # that changelogs throughout the repo are edited. The advantage of this
  # implemenation is that packages or projecs with independent changelogs will
  # can still have automation without requiring edits to the root changelog.
  #
  # IF a Go-related file (filter "nibiru-go") is changed, the
  #   "dangoslen/changelog-enforcer" action runs, enforcing changes to the
  #   CHANGELOG.md file at the root of the repo.
  #
  # ELSE IF no changelog was modified anywhere else, then
  #   "dangoslen/changelog-enforcer" runs.
  #
  # ELSE, some changelog file must have been modified that was not the root
  #   one, so the workflow can skip  "dangoslen/changelog-enforcer".
